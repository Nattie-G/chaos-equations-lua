  --[[  ideas for fixing playback speed
  1. look 10 frames ahead, identify any "jumps," fix "keyframes"
  and smoothe out speed transitions.
  2. if these N frames don't have high "interest" or high speed
  movement, adjust the step upwards
  3. In the case of sufficiently low-interest stetches, conduct
  an extended search to identify the next "hotspot" and smoothe
  fast-forward to there


  1. consider the whole period from -2 < t < 2 at a fine scale
  2. identify "hot," "cold" and "dead" stretches
  3. identify appropriate speed curve for each hot spot
  4. optimise each hot-spot's keyframes and fix pop-in?
  5. arrange "frames" as a table of t-values
    (reverse play order for better efficiency)
  6. generate "in-between" or skip existing frames based on user interaction


  1. just rewrite the "interest function" to be better
  2. clamp speed more aggressively where appropriate
  3. use rolling interest value that updates each frame?
